## The Big Picture
> The five classic components of a computer are input, output, memory, datapath, and control, with the last two sometimes combined and called the processor.

> Both hardware and software consist of hierarchical layers using abstraction, with each lower layer hiding details from the level above. One key interface between the levels of abstraction is the *instruction set architecture* - the interface between the hardware and low-level software. This abstract interface enables many *implementations* of varying cost and perfomance to run identical software.
